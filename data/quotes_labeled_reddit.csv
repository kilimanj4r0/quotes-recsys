274,"If you have ever seen the play Peter Pan you will remember how the pirate chief was always making his dying speech because he was afraid that possibly when the time came for him to die he might not have time to get it off his chest. It is much the same with me, and so, although I am not at this moment dying, I shall be doing so one of these days and I want to send you a parting word of goodbye.

Remember, it is the last you will ever hear from me, so think it over.

I have had a most happy life and I want each one of you to have as happy a life too.

I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness doesn't come from being rich, nor merely from being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so can enjoy life when you are a man.

Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one.

But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn come to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. ""Be Prepared"" in this way, to live happy and to die happy - stick to your Scout promise always - even after you have ceased to be a boy - and God help you do it.",0.07374496757984161,0.21042479574680328,0.043417587876319885,0.10489005595445633,0.033549319952726364,0.006396211218088865,0.016463709995150566,0.007489670999348164,0.00352127430960536,0.018127083778381348,0.004747344180941582,0.007335541769862175,0.35250726342201233,0.004876924213021994,0.0018422832945361733,0.3116863965988159,0.010871264152228832,0.10156026482582092,0.0013505631359294057,0.002043569926172495,0.0006077998550608754,0.002631087088957429,0.0005395279149524868,0.0008192936656996608,0.0014327897224575281,0.0030793563928455114,0.001144676236435771,0.0024803942069411278

Friends won't flock to someone who abandons the memory of his friends and gives up on the world just because things don't go the way he wants them to. That won't help fill the hole in your heart. And people won't help those who run away and do nothing. As long as you don't give up, there will always be salvation.",0.22661931812763214,0.0023206640034914017,0.005037392023950815,0.0831659585237503,0.004008998163044453,0.021937871351838112,0.0008060821564868093,0.0011402320815250278,0.03650472313165665,0.008641302585601807,0.014011825434863567,0.05828386917710304,0.455030620098114,0.10913166403770447,0.000602959597017616,0.004602349363267422,0.0029487197753041983,0.07418740540742874,0.002819717861711979,0.0035435552708804607,0.000631791481282562,0.006960683036595583,0.0009739924571476877,0.001036748755723238,0.002685847459360957,0.003733720863237977,0.0022402156610041857,0.0013407705118879676

Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie?

568,"Percy, let me go"" she croaked. ""You can't pull me up.""
His face was white with effort. She could see in his eyes that he knew it was hopeless.
""Never,"" he said. He looked up at Nico, fifteen feet above.
""The other side, Nico! We'll see you there. Understand?""
Nico's eyes widened. ""But-""
""Lead them!"" Percy shouted. ""Promise me!""
""I-I will.""
Below them, the voice laughed in the darkness. Sacrifices. Beautiful sacrifices to wake the goddess.
Percy tightened his grip on Annabeth's wrist. His face was gaunt, scraped and bloody, his hair dusted with cobwebs, but when he locked eyes with her, she thought he had never looked more handsome.
""We're staying together,"" he promised. ""You're not getting away from me. Never again.""
Only then did she understand what would happen. A one-way trip. A very hard fall.
""As long as we're together,"" she said.
She heard Nico and Hazel still screaming for help. She saw sunlight far, far above- maybe the last sunlight she would ever see.
Then Percy let go of his ledge, and together, holding hands, he and Annabeth fell into the endless darkness.",0.6634418368339539,0.0049040536396205425,0.19264526665210724,0.0970417708158493,0.0006814004154875875,0.009676816873252392,0.004300790373235941,0.002385584870353341,0.004443554673343897,0.0017005970003083348,0.007282425183802843,0.003442640183493495,0.007892003282904625,0.003174153622239828,0.0027152656111866236,0.002375406678766012,0.00038790947292000055,0.010155738331377506,0.001066606491804123,0.0006966796354390681,0.0008907510782591999,0.00029812127468176186,0.0005489907343871891,0.0018064092146232724,0.003541094483807683,0.0013012834824621677,0.002369750989601016,0.004766752477735281

592,"Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you‚Äôve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can‚Äôt wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it‚Äôs like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn‚Äôt exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day‚Äôs work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there‚Äôs no need for continuous conversation, but you find you‚Äôre quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there‚Äôs a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that‚Äôs so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.",0.0837828740477562,0.09920395910739899,0.09346334636211395,0.16690142452716827,0.08834989368915558,0.008993733674287796,0.036547355353832245,0.009280679747462273,0.008049839176237583,0.022931812331080437,0.004944826941937208,0.014108956791460514,0.44150182604789734,0.007059244439005852,0.0008949310285970569,0.01906871609389782,0.0019150384468957782,0.09305044263601303,0.0014026332646608353,0.003006687620654702,0.0016224742867052555,0.0019322589505463839,0.0007499221828766167,0.0007343562319874763,0.00843905285000801,0.011499582789838314,0.0018342816038057208,0.003373152809217572
