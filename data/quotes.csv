1150809,en,"If you have ever seen the play Peter Pan you will remember how the pirate chief was always making his dying speech because he was afraid that possibly when the time came for him to die he might not have time to get it off his chest. It is much the same with me, and so, although I am not at this moment dying, I shall be doing so one of these days and I want to send you a parting word of goodbye.

Remember, it is the last you will ever hear from me, so think it over.

I have had a most happy life and I want each one of you to have as happy a life too.

I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness doesn't come from being rich, nor merely from being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so can enjoy life when you are a man.

Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one.

But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn come to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best.

1091022,en,"Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.",https://quotepark.com/quotes/1091022-bob-marley-only-once-in-your-life-i-truly-believe-you-find/,Bob Marley,https://quotepark.com/authors/bob-marley/,"Love, Life, People, Pleasure, World, Jealousy, Smile, Beauty, Dreams, Hope, Fools, Disappointment, Way, Feeling, Soul, Thinking, Laughter, Memory, Chance, Waiting, Future, Help, Heart, Joy, Parting, Childhood, Hurt, Personality, Cry, achievement, achiever, allowance, back, being, believer, blue, brilliant, building, call, calm, clearing, cloud, competition, completion, content, contention, continuity, conversation, conversion, daily, day, difference, doing, dream, embarrassment, end, evening, everything, excitement, existence, experience, experiment, face, feel, finding, fool, forever, friend, goal, good, goodness, happening, hearing, horizon, import, importance, interest, laugh, likeness, making, many, mate, memorial, mind, most, need, note, occasion, opening, part, person, personal, phone, possibility, possible, presence, pressure, pressurization, quiet, quit, real, remains, safe, security, share, show, simple, sky, someone, something, song, special, storm, strength, tell, thing, treasure, turn, turning, wait, walk, walking, want, wind, wonder, work, working, worry, young, yourself, Love"
