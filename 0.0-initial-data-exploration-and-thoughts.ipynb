    "-  `bert-base-uncased-emotion` and `emotion_text_classifier` are trained to predict only 6 Ekman emotions, so we consider it as not enough for our task. Also, according to Demszky *et al.* [[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00547.pdf), the 6 emotion categories proposed by Ekman in 1992 are very basic and recent findings in psychology offered to have more complex \"semantic space\" of emotion."
